  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My result was ENFJ-T. Based on the results I am a protagonist who is 60% extroverted, 59% intuitive, 59% feeling, 51% judging, and 61% turbulent. I agree and disagree with this assessment. I believe that depending the situation, these results can change. The things I'm doing or the people I'm with can change the way I act which changes the results. If m working then, I'm a bit introverted, but that's only because I'm near strangers. When I'm with my friends, I am an extrovert and very outgoing. I can use these results to search for job/careers by getting a job based on these. I want to be a nurse, which i think suits me because because I am extroverted enough to the point where I can go up to patients and it wouldn't be awkward. These results have shown me that i have the chance to do want i want to do and the question also showed me a lot about myself.</p>
